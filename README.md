Design and Deployment of a Secure IOT based  Smart Energy Management System for Commercial Buildings

The growing demand for energy efficiency in commercial buildings has led to the 
emergence of smart energy management systems (SEMS) powered by the 
Internet of Things (IoT). However, while IoT-based solutions offer real-time 
monitoring, control, and optimization of energy usage, they also introduce 
significant security and privacy challenges. This paper presents the design and 
deployment of a secure IoT-based smart energy management system tailored for 
commercial buildings. The proposed system integrates a network of smart sensors 
and actuators with a centralized cloud-based platform for data analytics and 
decision-making. To ensure security, the system implements lightweight 
encryption protocols, secure authentication mechanisms, and anomaly detection 
algorithms to safeguard against unauthorized access and cyber threats. The 
solution also supports dynamic load management, real-time energy tracking, and 
automated control of HVAC, lighting, and appliances to optimize energy 
consumption. Experimental results from a prototype deployment in a commercial 
environment demonstrate up to 30% energy savings and enhanced operational 
transparency. This work highlights the potential of secure IoT frameworks in 
promoting sustainable and intelligent energy use in the commercial sector.
